  Yamam: A Semantic Hadith Search Engine
</h1>

## Project Overview
Yamam is an innovative search engine designed to revolutionize the way users interact with Hadith literature. Utilizing the latest advancements in natural language processing and semantic search technology, Yamam provides an intuitive and powerful platform to explore and discover Hadiths with unparalleled ease and accuracy.

The project employs a cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM), specifically Ara GPT, to deeply understand and analyze the Arabic text semantically. This AI-driven approach enables Yamam to interpret the user's intent and context behind search queries, moving beyond the limitations of traditional keyword-based search methods.

## Features
- **Semantic Search**: Leverages Ara GPT to comprehend and respond to natural language queries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A streamlined, intuitive design allows for an effortless search experience.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Utilizes sophisticated techniques to preprocess and structure Hadith data.
